Hi! This is a different format compared to what I'm used to. In this blog, the aim is to produce a series of posts, hopefully with a weekly schedule, on different issues that I've encountered when I've been either working or studying, especially for the web.

For the first couple of posts, I wanted to focus on the issues that I encountered when researching Web APIs - sometimes, it may be difficult to find a post for a small or trivial issue / function that no-one has referenced.

Finally, I have a few open source projects that I have been working on, including:

- [Offline Referencing Tool using Web Technologies](https://github.com/shavs/ort): A small tool that allows users to reference in the Southampton Solent University (Harvard) referencing system. It was interesting to build - it uses Service Worker to store requests offline, and also uses Dexie to index and store the references offline.

- [webcache-installer](https://github.com/shavs/webcache-installer): A tool that I developed to cache webpages offline in the terminal. This allows users to create a local, hostable version of the webpage. It makes use of GNU Wget as the archive builder, and SlimerJS as a screenshotting tool and PDF renderer.

Eventually, there will be more open source projects and examples and can be used as a working example.

Hope to see you next week!
