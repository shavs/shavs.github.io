# Introduction

This is a repository made by 1shavs43. The aim of the repository is to upload academic examples of code and documentation.

The website is broken into 6 main subjects:

* Developing for the Internet
* Graduate and Professional Design
* Human Digital Interaction Design
* Digital Communications and Networks
* Network Implementation
* Web Site Design

This is because it fits with the subjects that I have been taking at university.
